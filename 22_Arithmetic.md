# Operator precedence and associativity

Precedence      Operators       Associativity

Highest         *, /, %         lefft to right
Lowest          +, -            left to right

NOTE: Associativity is used only when two or nore operators are of same precedence.

e.g. +, - same precedence therefore we use associativity
