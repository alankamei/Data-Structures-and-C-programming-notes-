## Assignment Operators

- Values to a variable can be assigned using assignment operator.
- Requires two values -L-value and R-value.
- This operator copies R-value to L-value.

## Shorthand Assignment operators

+=        First addition then assignment
-=        First subtraction then assignment
*=        First multiplication then assignment
/=        First division than assignment
%=          First modulus then assignment
<<=         First bitwise left shift then assignment
>>=         First bitwise right shift then assignment
&= First bitwise AND then assignment
|=          First bitwise OR then assignment

^=          First bitwise XOR then assignment



## What is the output of the following program segment?

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char a = 7;
    a ^= 5;
    printf("%d", printf("%d", a+=3));
    return 0;
}


The output will be 51. you get it?
