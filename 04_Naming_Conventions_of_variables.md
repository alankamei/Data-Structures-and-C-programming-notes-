## Naming Conventions of variables

# Variable name: composed of letters or combination of letters (both upercase and lowercase) and digits.

                                            -- Rules --
1. Don't start with variable name with digit.
2. Begining with underscore is valid but not recommend [ because some identifiers which are reserved for system use starts with underscore which may cause you name conflicts]
3. C language is case sensitive. Uppercase letters are different from lowercase letters.
4. Special characters (@, #, %, ^, &, *..) are not allowed.
5. Blanks or white spaces not allowed.

-- Tips: Do not use loooooooonnggg... names for you variable name ----
